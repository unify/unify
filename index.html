        <article id="about">
            <h1>Native-like applications for smartphones, tablets and desktops</h1>
            <p>
                Unify is a project of software development at Product&Innovation at 
                Deutsche Telekom in Darmstadt. The project was initiated by Bernhard  
                Hochst&auml;tter (team lead) and Sebastian Werner (lead developer). The 
                original idea was to improve the efficiency of the development of mobile  
                applications.  There are several successful smartphone platforms with comparable 
                market shares. This is a major difference to the desktop  
                operating system market. In order to develop applications for a variety 
                of these devices, they must be developed, tested and maintained multiple  
                times. The market is currently characterized by a great movement. It is 
                unclear which platforms will be most successful in three years. 
                Investments in a specific platform are risky.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the savings from reuse for different platforms Unify increases the efficiency of development. It takes less diversified know-how. Since all developers use the same technology that results in a better scalability in application development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unify is based on Web technologies. Typical websites can not easily keep up with the look and feel of applications. Still Unify has exactly this objective.  A typical end user should not be able to distinguish an application built with Unify from a natively programmed application. The framework makes use of a whole range of modern technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Unify also bypasses the traditional limitations of a web browser. Detecting the current geo location, accessing the file system, etc. is easy to implement.
            </p>
            <p>
                The technology currently supports smartphones based on the platforms iOS (iPhone), Android (Google), and WebOS (HP / Palm). For next year, support for the new operating system of BlackBerry is planned. Moreover, Nokia's new platform MeeGo and Windows Phone support is scheduled as well. Tablets are another device category which should be supported by Unify in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first real application built using Unify was the Fan App by fussball.de. It has been successfully published to the Apple AppStore and Android Market. Previously there were only prototype applications to show of the power of the technology. One of them is available as a demo application as part of the Unify framework.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unify will be integrated with Developer Garden -a developer portal of Deutsche Telekom. Furthermore Unify is a possible technology used in the WAC (Wholesale Application Community) application SDK. WAC aims to build a common platform for the development and distribution of applications on a large set of different phones.

                <h1>FAQ</h1>
                <p>
                    <b>Q: Why Unify?</b>
                    <br>
                    A: Unify allows the programming of smart phone apps, regardless of
                    the operating system. With Unify one is able to develop an application for
                    the iPhone or Android-based phones like the HTC Desire in one process. This saves time and money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Q: What's Unify?</b>
                    <br>
                    A: Unify allows the programming of applications for smartphones,
                    tablets and desktops with a single technology. The main claim of Unify is to allow solutions which the end user can not differentiate from a natively programmed application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Q: What platforms are supported by Unify?</b>
                    <br>
                    A: At the moment Unify supports smartphones based on Android, iOS and WebOS. It also supports the three desktop operating systems Windows, Mac OS and Linux.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Q: What about smartphones from Nokia, Blackberry, etc.?</b>
                    <br>
                    A: The current priority is to support smartphone platforms with a working application market. In this aspect the iPhone and Android-based devices are currently the most interesting platforms. As soon as manufacturers of the other platforms achieve a similar popularity, Unify will also strive to support them. Support for BlackBerry OS 6.0, Windows Phone and Nokia’s operating systems is planned for next year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Q: Is not it difficult to desktop and smartphones using the same
                        to develop technology?</b>
                    <br>
                    A: The technical foundation is identical in all developments but large parts of the user interfaces will be optimized on a device category. Currently Unify distinguishes between smartphones (with touch screen), tablets and desktop computers. In contrast to the interface, the implementation of the business logic and data models is shared in all device categories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Q: Why does Deutsche Telekom develop such a solution?</b>
                    <br>
                    A: Currently there are no comprehensive and well-established solutions available. The cost of the native development for multiple devices are high. Each platform must be individually developed, maintained and improved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Q: Do external partners contribute to Unify? </b>
                    <br>
                    A: Unify has just been published as open source and thus allows external partners to use, extend and improve it was well. As open source software allows everybody to have a look at the code there is a good chance that the overall quality is higher than in closed software. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Q: What technology is Unify based on? </b>
                    <br>
                    A: Unify makes use of several existing frameworks and technologies. At its core it is based on web technologies. Unify makes use of HTML5 and CSS 3. The whole UI is generated via JavaScript on base of the qooxdoo framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Q: Are web technologies powerful enough? </b>
                    <br>
                    A: Web technologies are currently improved at a rapid pace. Browsers such as Firefox from Mozilla or Chrome from Google are improving their performance by about 30% per quarter. Impressive animations, playing audio and video files, accessing databases etc. is pretty easy to implement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Q: What distinguishes Unify from other solutions based on web technology? </b>
                    <br>
                    Unlike some older and less sophisticated solutions Unify aims to bring a native look&feel to applications. The usage of a professional and mature JavaScript framework helps developers building applications rapidly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Q: Is Unify prepared for the future ? </b>
                    <br>
                    A: In contrast to technologies which are based on a translation of program code, Unify is future safe, as the foundation is built on open and widely distributed technology. Though the improvements in the underlaying software the speed and the possibilities are quite good even on older hardware.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Q: Could web applications integrate themselves to the system?</b>
                    <br>
                    A: Web applications typically run in a browser, which does not allow any access to the system. That’s the so-called sandbox. A typical web application has no way to read e-mails or files of the user. Technologies like Adobe AIR or PhoneGap allows the break the boundaries of these sandboxes. These are basically installed like native applications and allow the web applications inside them to enjoy the same level of access and integration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Q: Why does Unify apply on  PhoneGap?</b>
                    <br>
                    A: PhoneGap is currently the only technology of its kind, which makes it possible to publish applications in the Apple AppStore and Android Market. For the moment this is the reason why it is more interesting for application developers than initiatives like BONDI or JIL. PhoneGap is open source and can thus be adapted perfectly to the needs of Unify.
